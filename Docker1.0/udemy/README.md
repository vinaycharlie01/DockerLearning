build in os


# Virtual machine
      1. big impact on os
      slow
      Higher disk space usage

      sharing and Re-building distribution is  dificult

      3.Encapsulate "whole machines"
      intend of "just app/environment"

# Docker Container
     1. Low impact on os
      very fast
      Minimal  disk space usage

      2. sharing and Re-building distribution is easy

      3. Encapsulate apps/environments
      intend of "whole machines"
